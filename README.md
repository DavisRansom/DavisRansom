Hi, I’m @DavisRansom!

I am a budding web developer based out of San Diego, with a degree in Psychology, a Masters in Education, and just over 15 years of teaching experience. I have now entered the tech space, I am learning so much every single day, and I am so stoked to see where it all takes me!

I’m fascinated by attempting to master web development, and I love volleyball, psychology, reading, and any other interesting ideas!

I’m currently learning full-stack web development through UCSD's Bootcamp. Right now we have been interacting a lot with JavaScript and we were just briefly introduced to jQuery and Bootstrap.

I also work (nearly full-time) for Accel Robotics, which is an innovator and provider of AI guided, checker-less stores. At Accel Robotics I supervise a small group at the AI Cart Review Team.

Also, I have been a professional volleyball coach for 25 years, currently coaching elite juniors volleyball at a top club in the nation.

I’m excited to collaborate on a project where I can learn more about, and help with, how to communicate most effectively with people through the medium of web applications.

Let's connect!
