Hi, I’m DavisRansom!

I am a budding web developer based out of San Diego, with a degree in Psychology, a Masters in Education, and just over 15 years of teaching experience. I have now entered the tech space, I am learning so much every single day, and I am so stoked to see where it all takes me!

I’m currently 3 weeks away from my Cerificate in Full-stack Web Development through UCSD's Bootcamp. Right now we are working with React.js and we practiced HTML5, CSS, jQuery, Node.js, MySql, Sequelize, Bootstrap, Handlebars, and learned MongoDB and GraphQL.

I’m fascinated by attempting to master web development, but I also bring a "very particular set of skills", including:

a. Leadership and Coaching at one of the country's top athletic clubs
b. Classroom Teaching for nearly 15 years at three of San Diego County's top private and public schools
c. Business Management through starting a Non-Profit Organization designed to increase access to volleyball in under"served" communities. As the CEO of that organization we grossed nearly $1 million since its inception and have been the starting point for many athletes who have gone on to play in college. 

I also worked for Accel Robotics, an innovator and provider of AI-guided, checkerless stores. At Accel Robotics I was an Independent Contractor working with the AI Cart Review Team.

Now I’m hooked on coding and would love to be part of a motivated team!
