Hi, I’m @DavisRansom!

I am a budding web developer based out of San Diego, with a degree in Psychology, a Masters in Education, and just over 15 years of teaching experience. I have now entered the tech space, I am learning so much every single day, and I am so stoked to see where it all takes me!

I’m currently learning full-stack web development through UCSD's Bootcamp. Right now we have been interacting a lot with JavaScript and we practiced HTML5, CSS, jQuery, Node.js, MySql, Sequelize, Bootstrap, Handlebars, and now we are learning React.js.

I’m fascinated by attempting to master web development, but I also bring a "very particular set of skills", including: leadership and coaching, classroom teaching, and I learned all aspects of business management by starting a non-profit organization designed to increase access to volleyball by providing affordable, excellent coaching, and being the CEO of that organization for over years. 

I also work for Accel Robotics, an innovator and provider of AI-guided, checkerless stores. At Accel Robotics I am a Independent Contractor working with the AI Cart Review Team.

Also, I have been a professional volleyball coach for 25 years, currently coaching elite juniors volleyball at a top club in the nation, and even. coaching collegiately.

I’m hooked on coding and would love to be part of a motivated team!
